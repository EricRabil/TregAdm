Servers are down for maintenance, check back in 2-3 hours.

Dynmap didn't stop running when I told it to, and therefore has taken up
almost all of the storage. I'm moving Dynmap to the HDD and the server
has to be off while I do that. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience...

I'm just going to delete the Dynmap folder all together because it can
easily be regenerated. --Eric 4/17/2016 2:33 PM
